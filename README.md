# Discord Quest Completer

A lightweight console-based utility designed to simulate eligible Discord Quest activities and automatically complete them using the Discord Desktop application.

This project focuses on simplicity, clarity, and long-term availability, offering a clean and accessible way to run quest simulations directly from Discord’s Developer Console.
