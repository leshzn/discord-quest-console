# Discord Quest Completer

A lightweight **console-based utility** designed to simulate eligible Discord Quest activities and automatically complete them using the **Discord Desktop application**.

This project focuses on simplicity, clarity, and long-term availability, offering a clean and accessible way to run quest simulations directly from Discord’s Developer Console.

## Overview

**Discord Quest Completer** detects active and incomplete quests linked to your account and simulates the required activity — such as watching videos, playing games, streaming, or participating in activities — until the quest is completed.

The script runs entirely inside the Discord client environment and provides **real-time progress feedback** in the console.

No installation. No dependencies. No background services.
